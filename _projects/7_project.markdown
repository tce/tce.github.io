Distributed agent systems provide a computational framework for developing dynamic, intelligent, and adaptive systems.  These systems can be used for many applications, including cyber situation awareness and monitoring, complex and adaptive stream processing for real-time data processing, or general-purpose distributed processing.  My research interests include framework and architectural issues in distributed agent system development, including security, performance, and ease of development.
