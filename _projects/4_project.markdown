My research in visualization focuses on developing visualization and information presentation systems that amplify human performance.   Performance-oriented displays do not simply provide raw system information, but represent system information through the lens of a system model that allows operators to immediately grasp the situation and determine appropriate actions to take. As part of my research, I've developed a set of principles for the construction of performance-oriented visual displays based on earlier work on the pioneering OZ human-centered flight display. I am applying these principles to many domains, such as flight and ground robot maneuvering.  However, my main research domain is cyber, where I am creating displays for situation awareness, intrusion detection, and determining mission impact.
