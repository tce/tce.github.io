	abstract = {The purpose of this article is to invigorate debate concerning the nature of analogy, and to broaden the scope of current conceptions of analogy. We argue that analogizing is not a single or even a fundamental cognitive process. The argument relies on an analysis of the history of the concept of analogy, case studies on the use of analogy in scientific problem solving, cognitive research on analogy comprehension and problem solving, and a survey of computational mechanisms of analogy comprehension. Analogizing is regarded as a macrocognitive phenomenon having a number of supporting processes. These include the apperception of resemblances and distinctions, metaphor, and the balancing of semantic flexibility and inference constraint. Psychological theories and computational models have generally relied on (a) a sparse set of ontological concepts (a property called ``similarity'' and a structuralist categorization of types of semantic relations), (b) a single form category (i.e., the classic four-term analogy), and (c) a single set of morphological distinctions (e.g., verbal vs. pictorial analogies). This article presents a classification based on a ``naturalistic'' exploration of the variety of uses of analogical reasoning in pragmatically distinct contexts. The resultant taxonomy distinguishes pre-hoc, ad-hoc, post-hoc, pro-hoc, contra-hoc, and trans-hoc analogy. Each will require its own macrocognitive modeling, and each presents an opportunity for research on phenomena of reasoning that have been neglected.

	abstract = {Intelligent systems are increasingly interacting with people, both in their daily lives and through their use in safety critical systems. Current research is focused on how to use intelligent systems in a collaborative way as a teammate, rather than a tool. This requires a better understanding of what behaviors enable effective human-agent teams. This paper reports an experiment where a human player collaborates with an agent to perform a maneuvering task while concurrently performing a memory task. The player must determine in which contexts the agent requires their input to achieve better combined game plus memory task accuracy scores. We hypothesized that high-performing teams would exhibit different patterns of control inputs when compared to low-performing teams and that these patterns of control would be made more evident with user interfaces that increased operator situation awareness. Preliminary results are inconclusive, but show different patterns of interaction between high- and low-performing teams.},

	abstract = {Information visualization has been a research topic for many years, leading to a mature field where guidelines and practices are well established. Knowledge visualization, in contrast, is a relatively new area of research that has received more attention recently due to the interest from the business community in Knowledge Management. In this paper we present the CmapTools software as an example of how concept maps, a knowledge visualization tool, can be combined with recent technology to provide integration between knowledge and information visualizations. We show how concept map-based knowledge models can be used to organize repositories of information in a way that makes them easily browsable, and how concept maps can improve searching algorithms for the Web. We also report on how information can be used to complement knowledge models and, based on the searching algorithms, improve the process of constructing concept maps.},

SAWD provides an interactive user interface that enables the intuitive description (either explicitly or by example) of the requirements, pre-conditions, and steps for defense installation, configuration, and operation in multiple operational environments. The defense wrapping produces a semantic representation of the defense, as well as the code necessary to manage the defense, which enables its seamless on demand deployment and control across multiple operating systems.

	abstract = {Developing trust in intelligent agents requires understanding the full capabilities of the agent, including the boundaries beyond which the agent is not designed to operate. This paper focuses on applying formal verification methods to identify these boundary conditions in order to ensure the proper design for the effective operation of the human-agent team. The approach involves creating an executable specification of the human-machine interaction in a cognitive architecture, which incorporates the expression of learning behavior. The model is then translated into a formal language, where verification and validation activities can occur in an automated fashion. We illustrate our approach through the design of an intelligent copilot that teams with a human in a takeoff operation, while a contingency scenario involving an engine-out is potentially executed. The formal verification and counterexample generation enables increased confidence in the designed procedures and behavior of the intelligent copilot system.},
