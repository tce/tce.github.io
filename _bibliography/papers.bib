abstract = {The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the nature of teamwork, leading to the emergence of human-agent teams across various domains. From cognitive assistants supporting astronauts to AI-driven automation in autonomous vehicles, AI is increasingly integrated as an active team member rather than a passive tool. The current paper explores the distinctions between human-human, agent-agent, and human-agent teams, providing insights into the roles AI can assume within collaborative environments. We examine established teamwork models, such as Shared Mental Model (SMM) and Co-Active Design, and present a human-AI team framework to understand how AI can effectively enhance joint activity, communication, and decision-making within teams. Additionally, the paper identifies current challenges with integrating AI into human-agent teams, including the lack of adaptive teamwork models and engineering limitations. By addressing these challenges and leveraging structured frameworks, organizations can optimize AI-human collaboration, fostering high-performance teams capable of excelling in complex, dynamic work environments.}

  abstract     = {This paper presents LEVIOSA, a novel framework for text- and speech-based uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory generation. By leveraging multimodal large language models (LLMs) to interpret natural language commands, the system converts text and audio inputs into executable flight paths for UAV swarms. The approach aims to simplify the complex task of multi-UAV trajectory generation, which has significant applications in fields such as search and rescue, agriculture, infrastructure inspection, and entertainment. The framework involves two key innovations: a multi-critic consensus mechanism to evaluate trajectory quality and a hierarchical prompt structuring for improved task execution. The innovations ensure fidelity to user goals. The framework integrates several multimodal LLMs for high-level planning, converting natural language inputs into 3D waypoints that guide UAV movements and per-UAV low-level controllers to control each UAV in executing its assigned 3D waypoint path based on the high-level plan. The methodology was tested on various trajectory types with promising accuracy, synchronization, and collision avoidance results. The findings pave the way for more intuitive humanâ€“robot interactions and advanced multi-UAV coordination.}

This paper focuses on applying formal verification methods to identify these boundary conditions in order to ensure the proper design for the effective operation of the human-agent team. The approach involves creating an executable specification of the human-machine interaction in a cognitive architecture, which incorporates the expression of learning behavior. The model is then translated into a formal language, where verification and validation activities can occur in an automated fashion. We illustrate our approach through the design of an intelligent copilot that teams with a human in a takeoff operation, while a contingency scenario involving an engine-out is potentially executed. The formal verification and counterexample generation enables increased confidence in the designed procedures and behavior of the intelligent copilot system.},

  abstract     = {Information visualization has been a research topic for many years, leading to a mature field where guidelines and practices are well established. Knowledge visualization, in contrast, is a relatively new area of research that has received more attention recently due to the interest from the business community in Knowledge Management. In this paper we present the CmapTools software as an example of how concept maps, a knowledge visualization tool, can be combined with recent technology to provide integration between knowledge and information visualizations. We show how concept map-based knowledge models can be used to organize repositories of information in a way that makes them easily browsable, and how concept maps can improve searching algorithms for the Web. We also report on how information can be used to complement knowledge models and, based on the searching algorithms, improve the process of constructing concept maps.},

SAWD provides an interactive user interface that enables the intuitive description (either explicitly or by example) of the requirements, pre-conditions, and steps for defense installation, configuration, and operation in multiple operational environments. The defense wrapping produces a semantic representation of the defense, as well as the code necessary to manage the defense, which enables its seamless on demand deployment and control across multiple operating systems. SAWD is a collaborative effort between Florida Institute of Technology, Raytheon BBN Technologies, and Air Force Research Laboratory.},

The argument relies on an analysis of the history of the concept of analogy, case studies on the use of analogy in scientific problem solving, cognitive research on analogy comprehension and problem solving, and a survey of computational mechanisms of analogy comprehension. Analogizing is regarded as a macrocognitive phenomenon having a number of supporting processes. These include the apperception of resemblances and distinctions, metaphor, and the balancing of semantic flexibility and inference constraint. Psychological theories and computational models have generally relied on (a) a sparse set of ontological concepts (a property called ``similarity'' and a structuralist categorization of types of semantic relations), (b) a single form category (i.e., the classic four-term analogy), and (c) a single set of morphological distinctions (e.g., verbal vs. pictorial analogies). This article presents a classification based on a ``naturalistic'' exploration of the variety of uses of analogical reasoning in pragmatically distinct contexts. The resultant taxonomy distinguishes pre-hoc, ad-hoc, post-hoc, pro-hoc, contra-hoc, and trans-hoc analogy.

  abstract     = {Intelligent systems are increasingly interacting with people, both in their daily lives and through their use in safety critical systems. Current research is focused on how to use intelligent systems in a collaborative way as a teammate, rather than a tool. This requires a better understanding of what behaviors enable effective human-agent teams. This paper reports an experiment where a human player collaborates with an agent to perform a maneuvering task while concurrently performing a memory task. The player must determine in which contexts the agent requires their input to achieve better combined game plus memory task accuracy scores. We hypothesized that high-performing teams would exhibit different patterns of control inputs when compared to low-performing teams and that these patterns of control would be made more evident with user interfaces that increased operator situation awareness. Preliminary results are inconclusive, but show different patterns of interaction between high- and low-performing teams.},
