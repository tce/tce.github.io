	Abstract = {Information visualization has been a research topic for many years, leading to a mature field where guidelines and practices are well established. Knowledge visualization, in contrast, is a relatively new area of research that has received more attention recently due to the interest from the business community in Knowledge Management. In this paper we present the CmapTools software as an example of how concept maps, a knowledge visualization tool, can be combined with recent technology to provide integration between knowledge and information visualizations. We show how concept map-based knowledge models can be used to organize repositories of information in a way that makes them easily browsable, and how concept maps can improve searching algorithms for the Web. We also report on how information can be used to complement knowledge models and, based on the searching algorithms, improve the process of constructing concept maps.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we introduce SAWD, a semi-automated approach for wrapping dynamic and moving target cyber defenses for cyber command and control operations. SAWD provides an interactive user interface that enables the intuitive description (either explicitly or by example) of the requirements, pre-conditions, and steps for defense installation, configuration, and operation in multiple operational environments. The defense wrapping produces a semantic representation of the defense, as well as the code necessary to manage the defense, which enables its seamless on demand deployment and control across multiple operating systems. SAWD is a collaborative effort between Florida Institute of Technology, Raytheon BBN Technologies, and Air Force Research Laboratory.},

	Abstract = {Developing trust in intelligent agents requires understanding the full capabilities of the agent, including the boundaries beyond which the agent is not designed to operate. This paper focuses on applying formal verification methods to identify these boundary conditions in order to ensure the proper design for the effective operation of the human-agent team. The approach involves creating an executable specification of the human-machine interaction in a cognitive architecture, which incorporates the expression of learning behavior. The model is then translated into a formal language, where verification and validation activities can occur in an automated fashion. We illustrate our approach through the design of an intelligent copilot that teams with a human in a takeoff operation, while a contingency scenario involving an engine-out is potentially executed. The formal verification and counterexample generation enables increased confidence in the designed procedures and behavior of the intelligent copilot system.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
