*Spring 2021 HCD 6701 Research Methods for Human-Centered Design*

This course presents the main ideas, techniques and differences in research methods used to conduct human-centered design, research and development. Students will learn to dessign, implement, and evaluate experiments that support hypothesis testing with human experimental participants. Students will design and implement an experiment during the course of the semester and present an evaluation of their project at the end of the term.

*Spring 2021 HCD 6380 Creative and Design Thinking*

This course introduces students to the theory and practice of design thinking for human-centered design of new products, processes, and organizations. Students will apply principles of design thinking to problems in different domains and learn which design thinking techniques should be applied for different types of problems in order to address the needs of the users being designed for. This is a ”hands-on” course where students will be generating numerous designs and evaluating not only the quality of those designs, but the effectiveness of the design process that generated them.

*Fall 2020 HCD 5210 Introduction to Human-Centered Dessign*

This course is designed to be the first course incoming students in the Human-Centered Design program take to understand the discipline in general. This class explores the processes and principles of the Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach to the development of efficient, useful, satisfying and safe interactions between people and automation. These interactions will enhance the effectiveness of human performance while reducing the cognitive load of the user during operation.  Students use ideas and principles of HCD to complete a semester project.

*Fall 2020 HCD 5802 Usability Engineering*

This class explores the processes and principles of Usability Engineering to develop efficient, useful, satisfying and safe interactions between people and physical or digital systems. The course covers concepts of usability, testing and evaluation methods, use of evalu- ation results, and integration with human-centered design. It discusses sensorimotor models and measures, ergonomic guidelines and recommendations, human-centered learning retention, human error management, efficiency, pleasure, emotional aspects, stress, workload and acceptability.

*Spring 2020 HCD 6380 Creative and Design Thinking*

This course introduces students to the theory and practice of design thinking for human-centered design of new products, processes, and organizations. Students will apply principles of design thinking to problems in different domains and learn which design thinking techniques should be applied for different types of problems in order to address the needs of the users being designed for. This is a ”hands-on” course where students will be generating numerous designs and evaluating not only the quality of those designs, but the effectiveness of the design process that generated them.

*Spring 2020 CYB5800 Information Visualization*

This course introduces students to the process of developing visual information visualizations that assist users in reasoning about information, finding anomalies or patterns in data, and hypothesis creation or validation via data exploration. Additional focus this semester on developing persuasive graphics to convey information.

*Fall 2019  CSE5400 Introduction to Human-Centered Design*

This course is designed to be the first course incoming students in the Human-Centered Design program take to understand the discipline in general. This class explores the processes and principles of the Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach to the development of efficient, useful, satisfying and safe interactions between people and automation. These interactions will enhance the effectiveness of human performance while reducing the cognitive load of the user during operation.

*Fall 2019  CSE5800 Deep Learning*

This  course  surveys the broad area of deep learning and deep reinforcement learning.  It introduces students to the process of developing and testing deep learning neural networks for use in classification, prediction, knowledge organization, and question answering.  The course presents the theory and practice of deep learning networks by exploring both fundamental and current topics in deep learning research.

*Spring 2019 CYB5675 Data Mining for Cyber Security*

This  course  explores  data mining and machine learning in cybersecurity environments. It includes a variety of data mining and machine learning algorithms and teaches students to use and assess their utility for cybersecurity tasks, such as the detection of signatures, anomalies, scans, and intrusions.

*Spring 2019 CYB5800 Information Visualization*

This course introduces students to the process of developing visual information visualizations that assist users in reasoning about information, finding anomalies or patterns in data, and hypothesis creation or validation via data exploration. Updated this semester to look at issues involving web-based front-end development for creating and working with ontologies.

*Fall 2018 CSE5290 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence*

This course provides students with theoretical knowledge and practical experience in knowledge representation, search and heuristics, reasoning with certainty and uncertainty, and learning techniques.  Students conducted research projects covering many of these topics.

*Spring 2018 CYB5800 Information Visualization*

This course introduces students to the process of developing visual information visualizations that assist users in reasoning about information, finding anomalies or patterns in data, and hypothesis creation or validation via data exploration. Updated this semester to focus on performance-enhancing displays for users in highly-focused or safety-critical domains.

*Fall 2017 CSE5310 Management and Processing of Big Data*

This course provides students with theoretical knowledge and practical experience in data storage, management and retrieval for analysis or operations. Students will explore the transition from traditional data warehouse architectures to modern big-data architectures that robustly handle data variety, volumes and velocities.

*Spring 2017 CYB5800 Information Visualization*

This course introduces students to the process of developing visual information visualizations that assist users in reasoning about information, finding anomalies or patterns in data, and hypothesis creation or validation via data exploration. The course presents the theory and practice of information visualization by exploring both fundamental and current topics in information visualization, including data and process abstraction, design techniques to emphasize salient information characteristics, how perception informs visualization design, and how effective visualizations can be used to improve operator performance in a number of tasks. Students will work with real-world data and will use state-of-the-art programming frameworks to create visualizations directed to solve specific user problems and answer specific user questions.

*Fall 2016 CYB5675 Data Mining for Cyber Security*

This  course  explores  data mining and machine learning in cybersecurity environments. It includes a variety of data mining and machine learning algorithms and teaches students to use and assess their utility for cybersecurity tasks, such as the detection of signatures, anomalies, scans, and intrusions.

*Spring 2016 CYB5800 Network Security Reasoning*

This course covers the use of knowledge representations for network operations and cybersecurity.  Students will learn to use formal ontologies, markup languages, and specialized knowledge representations to reason about network security events.
