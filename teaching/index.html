<p><em>Spring 2021 HCD 6380 Creative and Design Thinking</em></p>

<p>This course introduces students to the theory and practice of design thinking for human-centered design of new products, processes, and organizations. Students will apply principles of design thinking to problems in different domains and learn which design thinking techniques should be applied for different types of problems in order to address the needs of the users being designed for. This is a ”hands-on” course where students will be generating numerous designs and evaluating not only the quality of those designs, but the effectiveness of the design process that generated them.</p>

<p><em>Fall 2020 HCD 5210 Introduction to Human-Centered Design</em></p>

<p>This course is designed to be the first course incoming students in the Human-Centered Design program take to understand the discipline in general. This class explores the processes and principles of the Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach to the development of efficient, useful, satisfying and safe interactions between people and automation. These interactions will enhance the effectiveness of human performance while reducing the cognitive load of the user during operation.  Students use ideas and principles of HCD to complete a semester project.</p>

<p><em>Fall 2020 HCD 5802 Usability Engineering</em></p>

<p>This class explores the processes and principles of Usability Engineering to develop efficient, useful, satisfying and safe interactions between people and physical or digital systems. The course covers concepts of usability, testing and evaluation methods, use of evalu- ation results, and integration with human-centered design. It discusses sensorimotor models and measures, ergonomic guidelines and recommendations, human-centered learning retention, human error management, efficiency, pleasure, emotional aspects, stress, workload and acceptability.</p>

<p><em>Spring 2020 HCD 6380 Creative and Design Thinking</em></p>

<p>This course introduces students to the theory and practice of design thinking for human-centered design of new products, processes, and organizations. Students will apply principles of design thinking to problems in different domains and learn which design thinking techniques should be applied for different types of problems in order to address the needs of the users being designed for. This is a ”hands-on” course where students will be generating numerous designs and evaluating not only the quality of those designs, but the effectiveness of the design process that generated them.</p>

<p><em>Spring 2020 CYB5800 Information Visualization</em></p>

<p>This course introduces students to the process of developing visual information visualizations that assist users in reasoning about information, finding anomalies or patterns in data, and hypothesis creation or validation via data exploration. Additional focus this semester on developing persuasive graphics to convey information.</p>

<p><em>Fall 2019  CSE5400 Introduction to Human-Centered Design</em></p>

<p>This course is designed to be the first course incoming students in the Human-Centered Design program take to understand the discipline in general. This class explores the processes and principles of the Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach to the development of efficient, useful, satisfying and safe interactions between people and automation. These interactions will enhance the effectiveness of human performance while reducing the cognitive load of the user during operation.</p>

<p><em>Fall 2019  CSE5800 Deep Learning</em></p>

<p>This  course  surveys the broad area of deep learning and deep reinforcement learning.  It introduces students to the process of developing and testing deep learning neural networks for use in classification, prediction, knowledge organization, and question answering.  The course presents the theory and practice of deep learning networks by exploring both fundamental and current topics in deep learning research.</p>

<p><em>Spring 2019 CYB5675 Data Mining for Cyber Security</em></p>

<p>This  course  explores  data mining and machine learning in cybersecurity environments.
